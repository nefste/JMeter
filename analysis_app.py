    - **Throughput**: The number of requests that are processed per time unit (e.g., requests per second). Higher throughput indicates better performance.
    - **Average**: The mean response time. It's the total response time divided by the number of requests.
    - **Median**: The median response time. 50% of the requests are processed within this time.
    - **90% Line**: 90% of the requests are processed within this time. It's a measure of the tail latency.
    - **95% Line**: 95% of the requests are processed within this time. It's also a measure of the tail latency.
    - **99% Line**: 99% of the requests are processed within this time, indicating the performance for nearly all the requests.
